## Can I customise my dashboard?

Yes, you can! To customise your dashboard navigate to People > Administrators and click on the relevant profile. You can then find the button “Configure Dashboard” on the toolbar. Alternatively, when logged in, you can click in the top-right corner of your screen and select 'Account'.

To edit the panels on your dashboard simply move the sections from the right side into the left to show them on the Dashboard. If a section has half width, then you should put it beside another half width panel to prevent blank space.

## Can I remove panels from my dashboard/reset my dashboad?

Yes, simply move a panel to the right hand column to have it not show up on your dashboard. If at any time you wish to reset your dashboard to the default, simply click 'Reset Dashboard' on the Configure Dashboard page.
## Why don't my tutors like me?
